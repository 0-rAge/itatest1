  <h1>Interest in IT</h1>
  <h2>a.	What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h2>
  <p>I remember it distinctly. The pleasure of witnessing the works of my first 3D print. Holding the product of my own making was a surreal experience. Then more than ever is when I fell in love with IT. One of my many interests in learning IT is to better understand the rapid changes in our daily lives. I have always taken a mild interest in IT, and more recently, with significant developments in AI, I feel like it is almost crucial to dig deeper into the world of IT. As mentioned above, the point in time where I began to love IT was when I first started 3D printing. This was around 2020, and I have since had a lot of time to experiment with this hobby skill. I have also taken an interest in building FPV drones, which has given me knowledge in more than one different skill in IT, such as coding, wiring, and soldering.</p>

  <h2>b.	Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
  <p>I have chosen RMIT due to its outstanding reputation in technology. I have always hoped to get into such a well-recognised and respected university, and thanks to its online option, I am now able to. I have been homeschooled for the past four years (currently in year 10). I chose RMIT due to it offering early entry. This has opened up an alternative pathway, allowing me to get a significant headstart in my tertiary education. Starting studying at RMIT this early has given me a challenge that will push me to thrive for larger goals.</p>

  <h2>c.	What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
  <p>Throughout my studies in IT, I hope to become fluent in more than one programming language, such as HTML, Java and C++. In the future, I believe that all security will be a form of cyber security in one way or another. The rapid movement to an all-technological world presents a need for a detailed understanding of cyber security. In addition to the above, I hope to acquire a broader knowledge of IT. Learning how to apply IT to solve problems in our daily lives is also something essential that I hope to learn from future studies. IT is already used widely in our daily lives to solve issues and assist people and businesses in making tasks more accessible and effective. This will only increase over time, and I hope to have the skills to allow me to be at the forefront of this exciting, innovative time.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>The position mentioned above is a Software engineering position for a well-known company, 'MoTeC', which deals with technologically tuning race cars for optimal track performance. The job is to develop C++ code to improve the accuracy of automotive-related network devices. This job appeals to me due to the fact that my work will be manifested as a physical product that is already publicly viewed and admired.</li>
    <li>The above-listed job requires many prerequisite skills and experience. This includes knowledge and fluency in C++, Experience working with Linux, experience building and working with Linux/or RTOS environments, and 4+ years of experience working with C++ systems.</li>
    <li>My plan for obtaining the necessary qualifications is purely through dedication and studying. Learning and being fluent in C++ may take time and will be an essential skill for this particular job. Likewise, understanding and having first-hand experience with Linux or RTOS will take time and persistence in wanting to achieve an understanding of it.</li>

  <h2>What do the test results mean for you?</h2>
  <p>The above test results show me that certain aspects of myself require much improvement if I look forward to being a helpful member of any team environment. The combined results of all three tests show me where I am lacking. For example, the Myers-Brigg test showed that I am 57%  introverted. I plan on solving this by forcing myself into a social environment more often.</p>

  <h2>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h2>
  <p>As the above test results show, I am very observant, allowing me to see and solve any team-related issues early on. The Myres-Brigg test also indicates that I am 60% feeling. This will allow me to create a safe environment and a personal connection with team members. I also view myself as flexible concerning learning styles. I can adapt and benefit from any presented learning style.</p>

  <h2>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h2>
  <p>When forming a team, I am now aware of which aspects I should put more effort into creating a comfortable team environment. My ability to connect and understand someone's emotional position will allow me to allocate them an appropriate team position. Although my creativity may need some help, I am confident that I will be able to connect with everyone in a way best for each unique individual. I am constantly striving for improvement, and I feel like this will show in my efforts to build a team.</p>
